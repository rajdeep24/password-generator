# password-generator

## Description

For this project, the goal was to create a password generator that provided a users a randomly generated password based on their criteria selection. When the user clicks the button titled, "Generate Password," the user is prompted to select the number of characters for their randomly generated password with a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 128. Once the user selects their desired character length, the user is then taken through a series of confirmations in choosing the type of character they would like their randomly generated password to contain. This includes, special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. The user has to select at least one character type or else the application will not generate a password.

The purpose of this project is to learn how to leverage various tools we learned in Javascript so far. Within my javascript file, I used a variety of variables with multiple value types that included:

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays

Additionally, I leveraged prompts, confirmations, alerts, functions, for loops, return statements, and conditional statements such if/else. Furthermore, I leveraged various global methods such as Math.random and Math.floor to randomly select and generate values from an array. I also created empty arrays that were eventually populated with values based on the charter types selected by the users.

This project taught me how to break down large problems into small manageable pieces. I learned how to define my process before even writing a single line of code. I learned the importance of writing effective psuedocode.

## Credits

I would like to credit my peers, instructors, and teacher assistants from the GT bootcamp. They were an integral part in providing the essential knowledge and guidance needed to accomplish this task. Additionally, I would like to thank my tutor, Kevin Ferguson. He helped me understand the importance of psecoding and how to logically build your process before writing a single line of code. He helped me reinforce key javascript concepts that would allow me to develop a functioning password generator.
